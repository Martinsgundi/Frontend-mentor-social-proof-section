### What I learned

First time working with background images, position, size e.t.c, so this project was a perfect opportunity to get my hands around it and I'm glad I carrried it out successfully
Below is a snippet of my background styles:

```css
body {
    background-image: 
        url(../images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg),
        url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg)
    ;
    background-position: top left, bottom right;
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
    background-size: 100% 13.5rem, 100% 31rem;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Controlling background-images | CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k) - This helped me on handling background images, also made know that more than one background image can be inputed and styled in one element. I really liked his pattern and will use it going forward. I encourage anyone reading to check it out!
